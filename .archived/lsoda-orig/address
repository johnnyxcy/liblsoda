I'm told by Steve Nichols at Georgia Tech that you are interested in
a stiff integrator.  Here's a translation of the fortran code LSODA.

Please note
that there is no comment.  The interface is the same as the FORTRAN
code and I believe the documentation in LSODA will suffice.
As usual, a free software comes with no guarantee.
